Hi there, let me explain better this project that I`ve tryed to work on.

I've tried to finish it by today and gave my best!

Even thought the project is not running, I'm pretty proud of how much I've done in so little time.

the project has 3 commands that don't work.

the database was created manually and the tables and fields were supose to be created by the application.

I intend on working on this even after this oportunity in order to get better on this especific topic.

being no proficient on nodejs and even less on typescript I was able to try hard and even thought I'm not satisfied with the results, was a great experience anyhow.
